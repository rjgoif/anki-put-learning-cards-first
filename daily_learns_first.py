## this is an Anki 2.1 update of my popular Anki 2.0 add-on
## that changes the order of your daily reviews: 

## This is a simple add-on that inserts the daily-learning cards, i.e.
## cards in the learning queue with intervals that crossed the day turnover,
## before starting standard reviews (the green number). Normally these cards
## daily-learning cards go last, but I want them to go first. 

## as of beta 32, there is an option to enable this built into Anki if you are using the 
## v2 scheduler. 
## HOWEVER, I still think the learning reviews should come before new reviews. So I have built that in. If you use v2, this add-on respects the option toggle built into native Anki.
## I won't be testing v2 myself, so if it works for you please let me know via Github

## a legacy version will be uploaded to Github for anyone holding out with Anki 2.0.
